Project Title: Meal on Wheels

**Description:**
Developed a web-based meal delivery application, Meal on Wheels, using a combination of React.js for the frontend, Spring (STS) for the backend, and VS Code as the primary development environment. The application allows users to browse meal options, place orders, and track delivery status.

**Role:**
As a key member of the development team, I contributed to both frontend and backend development tasks. My responsibilities included designing user interfaces, implementing frontend components with React.js, developing backend APIs with Spring (STS), and integrating the frontend with the backend.

**Technologies Used:**

-React.js: Used React.js library to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces for the Meal on Wheels application. Developed reusable components and managed application state efficiently using React's features.

-Spring (STS): Leveraged Spring framework for building robust and scalable backend services. Implemented RESTful APIs, request handling, and data processing using Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and other Spring modules.

-VS Code: Utilized Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the primary code editor for frontend and backend development. Leveraged its powerful features and extensions to streamline the development workflow.

-MySQL Database: Implemented a relational database using MySQL to store meal data, user information, and order details. Designed database schemas, created tables, and optimized queries for efficient data retrieval and storage.

**Features:**

-User Authentication: Implemented user authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure user accounts and restrict access to certain features.

-Meal Catalog: Created a catalog of available meals with detailed descriptions, images, and pricing information for users to browse and select from.

-Order Management: Developed features for users to add meals to their cart, place orders, and track order status in real-time.

-Admin Panel: Implemented an admin panel to manage meal inventory, view orders, and generate reports for business insights.

-Responsive Design: Ensured that the Meal on Wheels application is responsive and accessible across various devices and screen sizes for a seamless user experience.
